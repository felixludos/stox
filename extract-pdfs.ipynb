S&P uses the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)SM, an industry classification system developed by S&P in\\ncollaboration with Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI).\\nA company is assigned to a single GICS sub-industry according to the definition of its principal business activity as determined by Standard & Poor\\'s and MSCI.\\nRevenues are a significant factor in defining principal business activity; however, earnings analysis and market perception are also important criteria for\\nclassification.\\nSecurities are first grouped into their respective S&P GIC Industry, null values are removed and then the percentile is computed. The percentile is the value of a\\nvariable below which a certain percent of observations fall. So the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20 percent of the observations may be\\nfound. Sometimes, being in the 100th percentile is not the best for items such as Debt to Capital Ratio where a lower number means less debt. Therefore, being\\nin the 1st percentile indicates lower debt than its peers in the industry.\\nThe Industry Average is a market cap-weighted average of the non-null values in the industry.\\nReport created on August 25, 2021\\nThe content on this page is provided by third parties and not Fidelity.
